We are not trying to define a large stack, become a big marketing organization or throw large conferences. We are focused on the container image format and runtime, areas where stability and standardization are more important, so that we can allow innovation to happen around us. To use an analogy, we are agreeing on the width of the train tracks, so we can all go off individually and try to build the fastest engines.</p><h2 id=the-specific-duties-of-the-oci-include>The specific duties of the OCI include:
<a class=headline-hash href=#the-specific-duties-of-the-oci-include><span class="icon hashlink"><ion-icon name=link-sharp class=align-middle></ion-icon></span></a></h2><ul><li>Creating a formal specification for container image formats and runtime, which will allow a compliant container to be portable across all major, compliant operating systems and platforms without artificial technical barriers.
Accepting, maintaining and advancing the projects associated with these standards (“Projects”). It will look to agree on a standard set of container actions (e.g., start, exec, pause) as well as runtime environment associated with container runtime.</li><li>Harmonizing the above-referenced standard with other proposed standards, including the appc specification.</li></ul><h2 id=why-have-all-of-these-companies-come-together>Why have all of these companies come together?

Almost all major IT vendors and cloud providers have announced container-based solutions, and there has been a proliferation of start-ups founded in this area as well. While the proliferation of ideas in this space is welcome, the promise of containers as a source of application portability requires the establishment of certain standards around format and runtime. While the rapid growth of the Docker project has served to make the Docker image format a de facto standard for many purposes, there is widespread interest in a single, open container specification, which is:</p><ul><li>not bound to higher level constructs such as a particular client or orchestration stack,</li><li>not tightly associated with any particular commercial vendor or project, and
portable across a wide variety of operating systems, hardware, CPU architectures, public clouds, etc.</li></ul><h2 id=how-does-this-benefit-users>How does this benefit users?
<a class=headline-hash href=#how-does-this-benefit-users><span class="icon hashlink"><ion-icon name=link-sharp class=align-middle></ion-icon></span></a></h2><p>Users can fully commit to container technologies today without worrying that their current choice of any particular infrastructure, cloud provider, devops tool, etc. will lock them into any technology vendor for the long run. Instead, their choices can be guided by choosing the best tools to build the best applications they can. Equally important, they will benefit by having the industry focus on innovating and competing at the levels that truly make a difference. To use an analogy, why argue about the width of train tracks, when you can worry about laying track and building the best possible engines? Ultimately, we want to make sure that the original promise of containerization—portability, interoperability, and agility—aren’t lost as we move to a world of applications built from multiple containers run using a diverse set of tools across a diverse set of infrastructures.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-connection-between-this-and-the-appc-effort>What is the connection between this and the appc effort?

All tools for downloading, installing, and running containers should be well integrated, but independent and composable. Container formats and runtime should not be bound to clients, to higher level frameworks, etc.
Portable: The runtime standard should be usable across different hardware, operating systems, and cloud environments.
Secure. Isolation should be pluggable, and the cryptographic primitives for strong trust, image auditing and application identity should be solid.</li><li>Decentralized. Discovery of container images should be simple and facilitate a federated namespace and distributed retrieval.
Open. The format and runtime should be well-specified and developed by a community. We want independent implementations of tools to be able to run the same container consistently.
Code leads spec, rather than vice-versa. We seek rough consensus and running code.</li><li>Minimalist: The spec should aim to do a few things well, be minimal and stable, and enable innovation and experimentation above and around it.
Backward compatible: Given the broad adoption of the current Docker container format (8B+ container downloads to date), the new standard should strive be as backward compatible as possible with that format.</li></ul><p>You will note that a lot of these are directly adopted from the appc founding values. We want to make sure that this effort combines the best ideas from all existing efforts in this space.</p><h2 id=what-has-docker-done-to-help-create-this-foundation>What has Docker done to help create this foundation?

<a class=headline-hash href=#how-is-oci-different-from-a-traditional-standards-group><span class="icon hashlink"><ion-icon name=link-sharp class=align-middle></ion-icon></span></a></h2><p>Traditional standards groups are generally architect-driven and usually code comes after the specifications are defined. Standards are built first, and then all products must adhere to those standards. The OCI seeks rough consensus and running code first. The OCI projects are being developed by the community, and independent implementations of tools are encouraged to ensure that the same container can be run consistently. The goal is to have multiple implementations and do thorough testing while the specification evolves over time.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-ocis-perspective-on-the-difference-between-a-standard-and-a-specification>What is the OCI’s perspective on the difference between a standard and a specification?
<a class=headline-hash href=#what-is-the-ocis-perspective-on-the-difference-between-a-standard-and-a-specification><span class="icon hashlink"><ion-icon name=link-sharp class=align-middle></ion-icon></span></a></h2><p>A standard needs to live in a neutral place and is typically developed according to a specified set of rules and procedures providing consensus among many parties. Standards are often used as a reference design.
Specifications are generally works in progress, often developed by one entity which may use content from one or more standards and may alter said content to meet different needs. Specifications are usually specific to one scenario and can cover multiple areas and topics, whereas a standard is typically more general and usually narrow in focus. Specifications can also include non-standard materials and can be easily revised.
As we created the OCI, we wanted to be sure to have a trailing specification with leading implementations and to make things as lightweight as possible. The OCI is run more like a traditional open source project than a standards body, with a focus on running code through consensus. The OCI is providing a form and canvas for organizations to settle on rules for a variety of specs.</p><h2 id=will-oci-ever-add-additional-specifications-such-as-networking-inter-container-communication-or-distribution-to-its-scope>Will OCI ever add additional specifications– such as networking, inter-container communication, or distribution– to its scope?

There are specific details in the RELEASES file in how releases are managed. For example, major specification releases must release at least three release candidates spaced a minimum of one week apart. This means a major release like a v1.0.0 or v2.0.0 release will take 1 month at minimum: one week for rc1, one week for rc2, one week for rc3, and one week for the major release itself. Minor and patch releases will be made on an as-needed basis.</p><h2 id=when-will-the-certification-program-launch-and-what-will-it-mean-for-something-to-be-oci-certified-will-that-certification-give-the-industry-true-portability>When will the Certification Program launch, and what will it mean for something to be “OCI-certified”?

For example, the Cloud Foundry community has been an early consumer of OCI by embedding runc via Garden as the cornerstone of its container runtime technology. The Kubernetes project is incubating a new Container Runtime Interface (CRI) that adopts OCI components via implementations like CRI-O and rklet. The rkt community is adopting OCI technology already and is planning to leverage the reference OCI container runtime runc in 2017. The Apache Mesos community is currently building out support for the OCI image specification. Also, AWS announced that is supporting the OCI image format in its Amazon EC2 Container Registry (ECR).</p><p>Any container that runs in these environments is taking advantage of OCI efforts.</p><h2 id=will-the-runtime-and-image-format-specs-support-multiple-platforms>Will the runtime and image format specs support multiple platforms?
